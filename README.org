A UDP Messaging Application (P2P)

** Introduction

'Messages' is a UDP based, Peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application.
Communication is unencrypted and in no way is delivery guaranteed. In order for
a message to be received, a client needs to be listening. Retransmissions may
cause messages to be repeated.

This application was written to test how message transmission delays (eg. those
caused by interplanetary distances) affect message based communication.
